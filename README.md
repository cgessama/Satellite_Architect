Everything you need to know about this project can be found in [this video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-zcw6bwx0SUeFX14_3icuDMxNtaRcpJp)

This is my largest personal project at 5000+ lines and 60 + source files. To play downlaod the bin folder from git or get it from my [google drive here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w-hN0-AzVaKrQr_ceyg7GPdkFZIii-0b)
Run Space_Architech.exe from within the bin folder. 

Key Commands:
Q,E,W,A,S,D move the window arround
Scrolling zooms in and out
, (comma) switches between orbit and ground stage
ESC pauses
Backspace exits any menu
C adds $100 cash because the game isn't exactly balanced
